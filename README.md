# SimpleJsonReader
App goal - read json file with a name "json.json" from current executable directory and visualize code via bindable AvalonEditor. Reader supports automatically updating, 2 seconds. Monitor can be stopped and file can read forcibly. The file "json.json" integrated to project you can mofily it after startup. For code cleanup I used bundle CodeMain + XAMLStyler.
